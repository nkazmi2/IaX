%*WRITE ABSTRACT HERE*
*First thoughts, not even close to a final draft*\\
We present analysis of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of Supernovae (SNe)
 2010el, 2010ae, 2008ha, and 2008ge. These SNe are catagorized as Type IaX, a
 distinct category from Ia or II. IaX are notible for their low spectra luminosity and low
 ejecta velocities. The stellar populations around these four SNe were analyzed to
 understand the ages of the SNe. There is a correlation between the ages of the four
 separate SNe. The details of the analysis include an examination of wavebands 
 f435w, f555w, f625w, and f814w; adjusting the spectra for host and Milkyway (MW)
 reddening; and filtering out sources with respect to their crowding, sharpness, and
 roundness. The occurance and trend in ages shows that IaX are a common feature for
 all SNe. Further study needs to be done to have conclusive results.
