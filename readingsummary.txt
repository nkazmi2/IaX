A luminous, blue progenitor system for a type-Iax supernova

The leading models for SN Iax are thermonuclear explosions of
accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (C/O WD) that do not
completely unbind the star, implying they are “less successful"
cousins of normal SN Ia, where complete disruption is observed.

SNIax are found preferentially in young, star-forming galaxies

SN2008ge lacks hydrogen/helium, "favours a white dwarf progenitor"
^is euro spelling preferred in science papers?
SN2012Z, 2005-2006 & 2010 observations, progenitor could be of
low luminosity

best model for these SNe continues to be a deflagration

There are four scenarios for this source: it is
unrelated to SN 2008ha, it is emission from the SN itself,
it is the luminous remnant of the WD progenitor, or it
is the companion star to the WD.

(1) S1 is not the companion
star of in the SN 2008ha progenitor system and the blue
He-star companion has a luminosity below our current
limits, (2) S1 was a blue He star and the SN significantly
altered its appearance (which we consider unlikely), (3)
the blue emission from the SN 2012Z progenitor system
was from theWD accretion disk (a super-soft source) and
the companion star is red and lower luminosity like S1
(which McCully et al. 2014b consider unlikely), (4) S1 is
a He red giant, simply a slightly more evolved version of
the companion star for SN 2012Z, or (5) SNe Iax have a
variety of progenitor systems.

S1: it is not directly
related to SN 2008ha, it is the remnant of the WD that
produced SN 2008ha, or it is the companion star to the
WD that produced SN 2008ha.

Overall
the shape of the optical light curves are exceedingly similar, with
perhaps the only subtle difference being that SN 2012Z appears
to rise to maximum brightness at a slightly faster rate. This is
consistent with the 56Ni being distributed somewhat closer to
the surface, leading to shorter diffusion times.

PDDs are similar to deflagrations, but have a detonation
phase which produces a layered structure without requiring a
bound remnant. Because PDD models may vary in the ratio of
energy released to binding energy (Quimby et al. 2007) they produce
a wide range of 56Ni masses.

model the
SN Iax class should aim to provide robust radiative transfer calculations
in order to compare to the detailed optical and NIR
spectroscopic sequences now being routinely obtained at both
early and late phases.
