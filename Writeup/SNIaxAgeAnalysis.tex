\noindent We present an analysis of Supernovae (SNe) 2008ge, 2008ha, 2010ae, 
2010el. These SNe were observed using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the
435 nm, 555 nm, 625 nm, and 814 nm optical wavebands. 
These SNe are categorized as SNe Iax, a distinct category from SNe Ia. 
SNe Iax are notable for their low spectra luminosity and low ejecta velocities. 
The stellar populations around these four SNe were analyzed to understand
 the ages of the SNe progenitor prior to detonation.
In our study we examined the stellar populations
around each respective supernovae. We created color magnitude diagrams 
for each SNe and matched the sources to age isochrones. 
We found the ages for the populations surrounding SN 2008ge, SN 2008ha, SN 2010ae, 
SN 2010el to be 19.5-27.5 Myr, 52.5 Myr, 22.4 Myr, 65.0 Myr respectively. 
These ages indicate a correlation between young stellar populations and
SNe Iax. 
%There is a correlation between the ages of the four separate SNe. 
%The details of the analysis include an examination of wavebands ; 
%adjusting the spectra for host and Milky Way (MW) reddening; 
%and filtering out sources with respect to their crowding, sharpness, and

\section{Introduction}
A relatively new development in Supernovae (SNe) classification 
has been the addition of the Type Iax supernova (SN Iax) class.
These are separate from SNe Ia, which are characterized by a lack of 
hydrogen lines and are caused by thermonuclear explosions.
SNe Iax are theorized to be thermonuclear explosions of Carbon-Oxygen
White Dwarf (C/O WD) and they share spectral properties with SNe Ia.
However, SNe Iax have unique features which separate them from the traditional SNe Ia \citep{fol1304}. 

The differences between SNe Ia and SNe Iax begins with their luminosities.
SNe Iax possess a less luminous light curve, 
their absolute magnitudes fall between a range of 
``$-14.2 \leq M_{V,peak} \leq -18.4$ mag''
 \citep{fol1304}.
The SNe Iax lack an observable second maxima in the near-infrared (NIR),
which would be expected in SNe Ia \citep{li03}. 
They have a lower ejecta velocity and do not show hydrogen and helium in their
 spectra.
The appearance of hydrogen and helium only occurs when there are environmental factors, such as  
a circumstellar disks or intermediate mass elements donating the material \citep{fol09}. 
Though the explosion mechanics of SNe Iax are still unknown, the most accurate model
predicts a partial deflagration from the accretion of a Helium star 
onto a C/O WD \citep{krom13, fol1304}.

The host galaxies environments are significant, because
the metallicity of the host galaxy affects the luminosity and the age of the
SNe explosion.
SNe Iax have been identified in predominately late-time galaxies
and have not been observed in elliptical galaxies \citep{fol1304}. 
This is different from SNe Ia, which are impartial to the galaxy type \citep{van92}. 
We would expect the SNe in more massive galaxies to have a brighter 
luminosity than SNe from smaller galaxies because (ADD REASON)  \citep{fol1305}. 
Metallicity comes into play, because progenitors with high 
metallicity produce lower luminosity light curves for their SNe \citep{tim03}. 
However, we know this from observations of SNe Ia, we can only vaguely frame SNe Iax with this information. 

%INCLUDE: Information about the affects host galaxies have on SNe.
%This will be useful when comparing the ages and seeing if the
%galaxies were important factors (metallicity and luminosity)
As a new class of SNe, parameters such as typical host galaxy morphology,
 host galaxy metallicity, progenitor metallicity, and progenitor age of SNe Iax are still not well defined 
The parameter that will be examined in this paper is the ages 
of the surrounding stellar population of these Iax.
By studying the ages of the remaining stars around the SNe,
we can predict the age of the SNe Iax prior to detonation and 
see if there is a correlation of ages.  

In this analysis we study SN 2008ge, SN 2008ha, 
SN 2010ae, and SN 2010el. %, SN2012Z, and SN2014dt. 
The focus was on creating an age limit for the stellar populations around these SNe.
The stellar population around SN 2008ha was analyzed in Fig. 4 of \citet{fol1409}.
We recreated the model in this study so as to apply the same analysis method to
SN 2008ge, SN 2010ae, and SN 2010el. %, SN2012Z, and SN2014dt. 

In this paper, we will present our findings of Iax stellar populations.
In section 2, we will discuss the Spectroscopy and Photometry of 
SN 2008ge, SN 2008ha, SN 2010ae, and SN 2010el.
We will discuss members of the SNe Iax class in section 3. 
In section 4, we will discuss methods.
The discussion of our results will be in section 5. 
The World Coordinate System (WCS) is used throughout this analysis. 

\section{Spectroscopy \& Photometry}

This analysis used photometric images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) 
Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS).
The SNe were observed in the optical wavebands, 435 nm, 555 nm, 625 nm, and 814 nm . 
Data reduction was done using IRAF \footnote{IRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility)
 is distributed by the National
Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by the Association
of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement
with the National Science Foundation.},  cosmic rays were removed using the 
L.A. Cosmic Algorithm %\footnote{} haven't seen request for citation
the resulting images were used in the analysis. 

\section{Class Members}
As the catalog of SNe grows, we are able to identify new SNe as SNe Iax.
Of the list of identified SNe Iax, we will focus on observations of the following:  
SN 2008ge, SN 2008ha, SN 2010ae, and SN 2010el. %, 2012Z, and 2014dt. 
SNe Iax have been observed in a variety of host galaxies, from S0 to spiral galaxies, 
though SNe Iax have not yet been observed in elliptical galaxies\citep{fol09}. 
Comparatively, SNe Ia have been observed in all host galaxy types, 
including elliptical galaxies \citep{van92}.
These different environments, shown in Table \ref{tab:infogal}, indicate another relation between the SNe Iax. 
In this study, we examine the stellar environment around
SN 2008ge, SN 2008ha, SN 2010ae, and SN 2010el to 
such that we can determine a a typical age for SNe Iax.

The first observations of SN 2008ge were taken by
Chase on 2008 October 8.27 in NGC 1527, 23 days after peak brightness\citep{pig08}. 
SN 2008ge peaked at $M_{V,peak} = -17.4$ mag according to \citet{fol1011}.
NGC 1527 is a lenticular galaxy and is classified as an SAB0$^{-r}$.
 Previous observations of NGC 1527 do not show signs of star formation and a lack of massive, young stars near the
 position of SN 2008ge (see Fig.\ref{fig:08ge_whole}).
This, along with a large amount of 56Ni mass generated, \citet{fol1011} suggests a
white dwarf progenitor.
While there is no host galaxy reddening along the line of sight for SN 2008ge, there is 
Milky Way reddening, E(B-V) = 0.011.

SN 2008ha was first observed 2008 November 7.17 in UGC 12682, 
an Im type highly irregular galaxy, by POSS \citep{puc08}.
The first observations of SN 2008ha classified it as 
a SNe Ia with similar spectroscopic properties as SN 2002cx-like \citep{fol08}. 
At its peak SN 2008ha was observed with a $M_{V,peak} = -14$ mag, 
whereas SN 2002cx was observed at  $M_{V,peak} = -20$ mag. 
This puts SN 2008ha on the extreme end of this classification. 
It is less luminous and has one of the smallest observed ejecta velocity,
 which is ~3000$km/s$s lower than SN 2002cx. 
 \citep{fol09,fol1001,val09}.
We use use MW E(B-V) = 0.070 and no host galaxy reddening in this study. 
It was observed by the HST, it's false color image is presented in Fig.\ref{fig:08ha_whole}.

\end{centering}

SN 2010ae was first observed on 2010 February 23 in ESO 162-G017, a spiral barred galaxy \citep{pig10}.
SN 2010ae was initially thought to be a SNe Ia. However, that classification
was redacted when analysis of its spectra showed strong similarities to
SN 2008ha. SN 10ae was then reclassified as SNe Iax \citep{str1003}.
Because ESO 162-G017  is an edge on galaxy,
it is difficult to determine the locations of the neighboring stars the SN location.
SN 2010ae, Fig.\ref{fig:10ae_whole} has Milky Way Reddening of E(B-V) = 0.008, as well as
host galaxy reddening of E(B-V) = 0.50 +/- 0.42 \citep{str1401}.

SN 2010el, Fig.\ref{fig:10el_whole}, was first observed on 2010 June 19 in NGC 1566, 
an intermediate spiral galaxy \citep{mon10}. 
It was classified SNe Iax, because its
spectra resembled that of SN 2008ha \citep{bes10}.
SN 2010el has Milky Way reddening of E(B-V) = 0.008 and host galaxy reddening of 
E(B-V) = 0.8. 

%\subsection{SN 2012Z}

%SN 2012Z was first observed on 2012 January 29 in NGC 1309,
%a normal spiral galaxy, by LOSS.
%SN 2012Z was classified as Iax when initial observations of its spectra
%displayed properties similar to Iax (Cenko et al. 2012).

%\subsection{SN 2014dt}
%SN 2014dt was first found on 2014 September 29.8 in M61 (Nakano & Itagaki
%(2014) a). 
% It was quickly classified as SNe Iax and soon after was  observed with the HST. 
%The HST was able to collect data soon after the initial discovery. ()

\section{Methods}
We examined the stellar environments of SNe 
 2008ge, 2008ha, 2010ae, and 2010el 
to constrain the age of the SN progenitor system.
Catalogs of the surrounding stellar population 
were generated using DolPhot and HST photometric images. 
Using DolPhot we were able to extract sources from the HST images 
and put those sources in a catalog for each SNe. 
The catalogs included all star-like objects above
a signal to noise threshold, but not necessarily real sources, therefore the catalog had to be
filtered manually and through parameter constrains. 
The filters would include real sources over specific S/N thresholds, 
The parameters were adjusted for each SNe environment to extract real stars sources from the catalogs.

SN 2008ge was the only candidate that required special treatment in this analysis. 
The bright galactic nucleus made it difficult to identify sources and separate real stars from noise. 
In order to look at the region of space around the coordinates of the SN,
we made a subtracted image for each of the wavebands. This was essential in
properly identifying star-like sources. 
The subtracted images were created by splitting the galaxy into four quadrants, and subtracting 
cross quadrants. 

The remaining SNe did not have the same issues as SN 2008ge. We were able to look at catalog
 and HST image directly. The objects in the catalog were then filtered their 
S/N, the sharpness of the source, and by visual filters to identify real sources.

We included both host galaxy and Milky Way reddening in our analysis. 
 We found that there was no host galaxy reddening for SN 2008ge and SN 2008ha.
 Additionally, we found that there was Milky Way reddening for all 4 SNe.

\section{Discussion \& Results}



SNe Iax are a new class of SNe, they include a wide range of SNe with unique parameters.
This analysis studied the ages of the stellar populations to see if age was 
a factor in differentiating SNe Iax from others. 
By creating CMDs for the neighboring stellar populations,
we are able to measure the ages of the stars in that region. 
This allowed us to estimate the age the SN would have been prior to its detonation.

    	\label{fig:10elCMD}
\end{figure}
We examined the environment around SNe Iax. 
We modeled our analysis after a previous study of SN 2008ha from \citet{fol1409}. 
The \citet{fol1409} paper showed a color magnitude diagram (CMD), focusing on 
concentric regions of 75, 150, 225 pc (15, 30, and 45 pix ) around the SNe. 
With our catalog of stars, we were able to recover the same
results as \citet{fol1409}, shown in Fig.\ref{fig:08haCMD}.
We found the age to be 52.5 Myrs for the 
stellar populations around SN 2008ha. 

The age of SN 2008ge was constrained between high and low metallicity limits. 
Using those limits we evaluated the age to be between 19.5-27.5 Myr, Fig.\ref{fig:08geCMD}.
For SN 2010ae we found the age to be 22.4 Myr, Fig.\ref{fig:10aeCMD}. 
The final SN 2010el neighboring population was found to be 65.0 Myr old. 
We included the reddening vector to show the effects of dust extinction in Fig.\ref{fig:10elCMD}
From these results, there is spread of ages between Iax;
however, these estimations show SNe Iax to have relatively young ages. 
This information indicates that Iax come from young stars, though
our current set of data only includes 4 values. 
This gives a weak relationship which would be strengthened by recreating this analysis for the remaining SN Iax.
Further cataloging of Iax will add to the information we have and give us a better model for these types of SNe.
